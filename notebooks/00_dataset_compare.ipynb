    "### Observations\n",
    "After loading the Food.com dataset, it shows the following characteristics:\n",
    "* **Structure**\n",
    "    - Columns include: Name, RecipeIngredientParts, RecipeIngredientQuantities, RecipeInstructions, nutrition columns (Calories, FatContent, ProteinContent, etc.) and metadata.\n",
    "    - The dataset has **522,517 recipes**, which is large but still manageable for embeddings and FAISS indexing.\n",
    "* **Ingredients**\n",
    "    - RecipeIngredientParts contains ingredient names in R-style vector format. These can be cleaned by removing `c(` and `)` and parsing into a Python list.\n",
    "    - RecipeIngredientQuantities contains corresponding amounts in the same format.\n",
    "    - This split into **names** and **quantities** is extremely useful.\n",
    "* **Instructions**\n",
    "    - RecipeInstructions also comes in R-style list syntax.\n",
    "    - Steps are real, coherent, multi-step cooking instructions with excellent structure for RAG.\n",
    "* **Nutrition**\n",
    "    - Contains complete nutrition per recipe: Calories, FatContent, ProteinContent, etc.\n",
    "    - This makes nutrition estimates very easy.\n",
    "* **Missing Values**\n",
    "    - Missing values exist mostly in ratings, review count and servings.\n",
    "    - These are **not relevant for our project**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, this first dataset has clean and high-quality text for ingrediets and instructions, includes nutrition data, is very suitable for RAG and requires **moderate cleaning**."
